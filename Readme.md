**Authors**: Yodiaditya

### Introduction:
This repository contain notebooks of multiple case study on solving trivial problem using data-science solution.
The purpose is to help someone who curious on how to do ML and LLM problem solving start with simple problem.

### Case Study:
* Spam classification using BERT (NLP) and Tensorflow (Deep Learning) [Bert Spam Tensorflow](bert_spam_torch.ipynb)
